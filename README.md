Want to setup your own [BigBlueButton 2.0-beta](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.0/20overview.html) on a server that meets the [minimal server requirements](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/install/install.html#minimum-server-requirements)?  If your server is not behind a firewall (and don't worry if so, you just need to open some ports on the firewall as described later in this page), then you can install BigBlueButton 2.0 with a single command

~~~
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -v xenial-200 
~~~

This will take about 15 minutes (depending on your server's internet connection).  After it finishes, you'll see a confirmation message that BigBlueButton 2.0 is running and listening on the server's external IP address.  The script also installs the bbb-api demos so you can immediately try out the server. 

~~~
# Warning: The API demos are installed and accessible from:
#
#    http://aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd/demo/demo1.jsp
#
# These API demos allow anyone to access your server without authentication
# to create/manage meetings and recordings. They are for testing purposes only.
# If you are running a production system, remove them by running:
#
#    sudo apt-get purge bbb-demo
~~~

To test the server, open the above URL in FireFox as it doesn't need a SSL certificate to use web real-time communications (WebRTC).  You'll want to use WebRTC as it provides the highest quality, lowest latency audio in BigBlueButton.

The sections below go into futther details on quickly configuring your server with `bbb-install.sh`.


## Overview

The `bbb-install.sh` is a shell script that automates the [install steps](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.0/20install.html#step-by-step-install) for installing BigBlueButton 2.0.  

You'll need a server that meets the [minimal server requirements](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/install/install.html#minimum-server-requirements).  This can be a dedicated or virtual server.  

Furthermore, if you setup a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), such as `bbb.my-server.com`, that resolves to the external IP address of the server, then you can use `bbb-install.sh` to also install 
  * a 4096 bit secure socket layers (SSL) certificate from Let's Encrypt, 
  * the latest developer build of the HTML5 client, and/or
  * the GreenLight front-end.

We recommend installing a SSL certificate for production BigBlueButton servers as the certificate is a requirement for both Chrome and Safari to enable WebRTC audio for the user.

The source for the script is hosted at [github](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install).  While you could clone this repository an execute `bbb-install.sh` at the command line, to make it easy for anyone to run the script with a single command, we host the latest version at `https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh`.

### Server choices

Many companies, such as [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), offer virtual and bare metal servers that provide a Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit server with single public IP address (no firewall).  

Other companies, such as [ScaleWay](https://www.scaleway.com/), [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) offer servers that are setup behind network address translation (NAT).  That is, they have both an internal and external IP address.  The `bbb-install.sh` will do a bit of sluthing detect if the server has internal/external address and configure BigBlueButton accordingly.  

If your server is behind a firewall, such as on Amazon EC2 instance, then there are a few additional steps to configure the settings on your firewall (given below).  

Finaly, if you find `bbb-install.sh` is unable to configure server behind NAT, we recommend going through the [step-by-step](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.0/20install.html#step-by-step-install) for installing BigBlueButton.


### Configuring the EC2 firewall

If you want to install BigBlueButton 2.0 on an Amazon's EC2 instance -- we recommend a c5.xlarge instance type (or faster) when using EC2 -- then before your run `bbb-install.sh` you first need to configure the server's security group (a 'security group' is Amazon's term for a firewall) to allow incoming traffic on the following ports:

  * TCP/IP port 22 (for SSH)
  * TCP/IP ports 80/443 (for HTTP/HTTPS)
  * TCP/IP port 1935 (for RTMP)
  * UDP ports in the range 16384 - 32768 (for FreeSWITCH/HTML5 client RTP streams)

Here's a screen shot of what the security group configuration should look like to allow incoming traffic on the above ports:

![Security Group](images/security-group.png?raw=true "Security Group")

Before setting up a hostname, you need to assign an Elastic IP to the server so the IP does not change on reboot.   

We also created in [installation video on EC2](https://youtu.be/-E9WIrH_yTs) going through the above steps.

## Install and configure with an IP address (no SSL)

To install BigBlueButton on a Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit server, login as root and run the following command:

~~~
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -v xenial-200 
~~~

That's it.  The installation should finish with the following message:

~~~
** Potential problems described below **

......
# Warning: The API demos are installed and accessible from:
#
#    http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/demo/demo1.jsp
#
# These API demos allow anyone to access your server without authentication
# to create/manage meetings and recordings. They are for testing purposes only.
# If you are running a production system, remove them by running:
#
#    sudo apt-get purge bbb-demo
~~~

The script also installs the `bbb-demo` package, so you can immediately test out the install. 

If you want to remove the API demos, do the command

~~~
sudo apt-get purge bbb-demo
~~~

If you want to use this server with a front-end, such as Moodle, you can get the server's URL and shared secret with the command `sudo bbb-conf --secret`.

~~~
# bbb-conf --secret

       URL: http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx4/bigbluebutton/
    Secret: yyy

      Link to the API-Mate:
      http://mconf.github.io/api-mate/#server=http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/bigbluebutton/&sharedSecret=yyy
~~~

Since the server does not have a SSL certificate, use FireFox for sharing audio (at the time of this writing, FireFox does not require SSL to use WebRTC audio).  However, Chrome *does* require a SSL certificate, so users will get an error when sharing their audio with WebRTC.
 
We recommend installing an SSL certificate (see next section).
 
## Install with SSL

Before `bbb-install.sh` can install a SSL certificate, you first need to configure a domain name, such as `bbb.my-server.com`, to resolve to the public IP address of your server.  That is, the command `dig bbb.my-server.com @8.8.8.8` should resolves to the public IP address of your server.  

Next, you need a valid e-mail address, such as `info@my-server.com`, to receive updates from Let's Encrypt.  

With these two pieces of information, you can use `bbb-install.sh` to automate the configuration of BigBlueButton server with an SSL certificate using the following command (here we using the sample hostname and e-mail in the command, but you would need to substitute your server√®s hostname and your e-mail address):

~~~
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -v xenial-200 -s bbb.my-server.com -e info@my-server.com
~~~

The `bbb-install.sh` script will also install a cron job for you to automatically renew the Let's Encrypt certificate so it doesn't expire. 

## Install latest build of HTML5 client

To try out the latest build of the latest developer build of the [HTML5 client](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/html/html5-overview.html), add the `-t` option when setting up SSL (the HTML5 client needs SSL installed on the server).

~~~
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -v xenial-200 -s bbb.my-server.com -e info@my-server.com -t
~~~

After a few minutes, you'll have the HTML5 client is installed.  Use an Android or iOS (iOS 11+) phone/tablet to access your BigBlueButton server at `https://bbb.my-server.com/demo/demo1.jsp` and join using the HTML5 client.  The BigBlueButton server will detect when you are connecting from a mobile browser and automatically load the HTML5 client instead of the default Flash client.  Note: the HTML5 client is under [active development](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/html/html5-overview.html) and is not ready (yet) for production.

## Install GreenLight

If you want to add a frontend to your BigBlueButton server, where users can easily create meetings and invite others, you can install [GreenLight](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/install/green-light.html) by adding the `-g` option to the SSL options (GreenLight needs SSL installed on the server).

~~~
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -v xenial-200 -s bbb.my-server.com -e info@my-server.com -g
~~~

You can go to `https://<hostname>/` (where <hostname> is the host name for your BigBlueButton server) to launch the GreenLight interface.  To give users the ability to create and manage recorded meetings, See the GreenLight documentation for [setting up OAuth2 authentication](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/install/green-light.html#6-configure-oauth2-optional).

## Do everything with a single command

Lastly, you could do all the above with a single command:

~~~
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -v xenial-200 -s bbb.my-server.com -e info@my-server.com -t -g
~~~

# Troubleshooting and Feedback

## GreenLight not running

If after the initial installation GreenLight does not run (you get a 500 error when accessing it), you can restart GreenLight with the following steps

~~~
docker stop greenlight
docker rm greenlight
docker run -d -p 5000:80 --restart=unless-stopped -v $(pwd)/db/production:/usr/src/app/db/production -v $(pwd)/assets:/usr/src/app/public/system --env-file env --name greenlight bigbluebutton/greenlight
~~~

After which, you should be able to open the URL for your server and see the GreenLight interface.
